Transition Cambridge Food Group
===============================

This is just a repository to experiment with possible style 
for a new jazzy view of the [Food Group Home Page](http://www.transitioncambridge.org/thewiki/ttwiki/pmwiki.php?n=TTFood.HomePage).


Work in progress!
The idea is to get integrated with the current wiki system, so
we need more investigation!

The result is visible at http://michelemattioni.me/transition_cambridge_food_group/
